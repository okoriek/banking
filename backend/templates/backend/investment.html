                                    Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are time deposits offered by banks and credit unions that pay a fixed interest rate for a specified period. CDs are considered one of the safest investment options available because they are typically insured by government agencies like the FDIC in the U.S.
                                    <br>
                                    <strong>How CDs Work:</strong>
                                    <br>
                                    When you invest in a CD, you agree to leave your money with the bank for a fixed term, which can range from a few months to several years. In return, the bank pays you interest, usually at a higher rate than that offered by regular savings accounts. At the end of the term, or maturity, you receive your initial deposit plus the accrued interest.

                                    Dividends per share (DPS) represent the portion of a company's earnings distributed to shareholders, typically in the form of cash or additional shares. DPS is a key metric for investors, especially those focused on generating income from their investments.
                                    <br>
                                    <strong>Understanding DPS:</strong>
                                    <br>
                                    DPS is calculated by dividing the total dividends paid by a company in a given period by the number of outstanding shares. For example, if a company pays $10 million in dividends and has 2 million shares outstanding, the DPS would be $5. This metric helps investors understand the income they can expect to receive per share owned, making it a critical component in evaluating the attractiveness of dividend-paying stocks.

                                    Mutual funds are pooled investment vehicles that gather money from multiple investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. These funds are managed by professional portfolio managers who make decisions on behalf of the investors based on the fund's stated investment objectives.
